One beautiful features of the English language is that many words have suffixes that carry a categorical meaning. For example, words that end in '-cracy' denote a particular form of governance or rule. Coming from the Greek form '-kratia', meaning power, this combining form is used in familiar words like 'democracy' and 'bureaucracy'. However, there are far more words with weird and wonderful definitions.
