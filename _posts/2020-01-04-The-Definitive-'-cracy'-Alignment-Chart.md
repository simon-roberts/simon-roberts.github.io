One of the great features of the English language is that many words have suffixes that carry a categorical meaning. For example, words that end in '-cracy' denote a particular form of governance or rule. Originally coming from the Greek form '-kratia', meaning power, this combining form is used in familiar words like 'democracy' and 'bureaucracy'. However, there are far more words with that describe the various relationships that individuals have to the power structures that govern them. As a student studying business and computer science, it's often useful to examine real examples of governance from history to describe corporate and IT governance, which is part of my motivation of creating this alignment chart.

The 9 elements I've chosen showcase governance structures aligned to the 2-axis lawful/chaotic + good/evil chart seen in Dungeons and Dragons. In this case, good and evil refer to the outcomes seen by subjects of the various governance structures, and lawful and chaotic refer to the centralization/decentralization characteristic of each term.
