I'm a student in the Bachelor of Commerce program at the University of British Columbia, studying a combined major in business and computer science. I am a born and raised Vancouverite, but I'm currently living and working in Toronto as a business systems analyst at CIBC. Previously, I've held a variety of roles in operations, marketing, and sales development. 

Outside of my career, I have passions for distance running and for creating music. I'm a pianist and saxophonist by training, and have recently been producing electronic music in several styles. I also love nature, learning languages, and tinkering with projects on the web.
