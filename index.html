    <h1>Hi! I'm Simon.</h1>

    <br />

    <p>
      Welcome to my website. I've stripped the main site down to just HTML and
      <a href="https://newcss.net/">new.css</a> since I think it's more true to
      my brand than having fancy animations or javascript components.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in the intersection of technology, business, and public
      policy. My main goal is to create a world that is more free and just than
      the one that I've inherited.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm based in Toronto, Ontario as a Business Systems Analyst
      Co-op at CIBC, one of Canada's big 5 banks. There, I work on the next
      generation of finance and HR applications powering the future of banking.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm studying business and computer science at the University of British
      Columbia Sauder School of Business. I also sit on the Commerce
      Undergraduate Society's Board of Directors, governing the strategy of
      Western Canada's largest business students' union.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy practicing the many instruments I've picked up
      over the years (piano, saxophone, guitar, ukelele), running long
      distances, and practicing my French - I'm aiming to get past the A2 level
      of proficiency by the end of the year.
    </p>
