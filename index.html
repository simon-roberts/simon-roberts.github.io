    <p>
      Welcome to my website. I've stripped the main site down to just HTML and
      <a href="https://newcss.net/">new.css</a> since I think it's more true to
      my brand than having fancy animations or javascript components. It also
      makes my site load faster and is good for viewing on mobile.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm interested in the intersection of technology, business, and public
      policy. Currently, my main goal is to create a world that is more free and
      just than the one that I've inherited - whether through employment,
      entrepreneurship, volunteering or teaching. Admitedly, I'm still figuring
      this part out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm based in Toronto, Ontario as a Business Systems Analyst
      Co-op at CIBC, one of Canada's big 5 banks. I work on the finance and HR
      applications powering the future of banking in analysis, development, and
      support roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm studying business and computer science at the University of British
      Columbia Sauder School of Business. I also sit on the Commerce
      Undergraduate Society's Board of Directors, governing the strategy of
      Western Canada's largest business students' union. A more in-depth
      personal history can be found on my "Experience" page.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy practicing the many instruments I've picked up
      over the years including the piano, saxophone, guitar, ukelele. I also
      stay in shape by running long distances and practicing calisthenics. I'm
      also working on my French - I'm aiming to get past the A2 level of
      proficiency by the end of the year.
